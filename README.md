# mySweeper
A clone of a popular game that is included with Windows

Requirements for MVP
9x9 grid
Grid Behavior:
  During formation 10 of the cells get marked as a 'mine'.
  When clicked a cell looks to see if it is a mine.
  Additional behavior for if it is not a mine. HOLY COW!!!! This is hard :)
  If a mine game over condition....


assign value to cell, sort cells by value. Top 10 cells are mines.

might not do this exactly as stated:
After cells are determined to be mines, cells that are not mines look to see if they have a mine next to them. If they have one or more, they increase a counter
